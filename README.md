## My Projects

### Project 1: [Gamification in Education]
The "Gamification in Education" project aimed to integrate gamification techniques into higher education, specifically focusing on Discrete Mathematics. We developed a website called "Do It" to enhance student learning through gamified methods. The platform includes features for teachers to manage accounts and course materials, while students can track their progress, participate in interactive activities, and compete with peers. This approach not only makes learning more engaging but also motivates students to excel in their studies.
## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 5.3.3
- Php
